functions:

    centerlines.py
        - Contains centerlines class for handling centerlines
    
    find_generations.py
        - Contains function to retrieve generations from a 0D solver file

    project_org.py
        - Organizes Project of stenosis tool for development purposes
    
    solver_io.py
        - Contains Solver0D class for handling solver io operations

    flow.py
        - Contrain Inflow class for handling inflow file operations

    utils.py
        - Contains basic utility functions

centerline_gen_driver.py
    - Generates centerlines of entire model or tuning model

calculate_rcr_bc.py
    - Performs automatic tuning (only for healthy models) and splitting of bc of model, if a rcrt.dat file is unavailable
    - Converts 3d rcrt.dat files to 0D version -> for stenosis models


solver_gen_driver.py
    - generates a full 0d segmentation of model. rcrt.dat files must be in solver directory

artificial_stenosis_driver.py
    - Constructs artificial stenosis models from healthy pulmonary models

stenosis_detection_driver.py
    - Takes a control model, computes the average resistances for each generation (by vessel lengths) and iterates over a test model identifying any vessel segments that have larger than r_threshold times the R_poiseuille as the control average (generation-wise).
    - pulmonary models are scaled by bsa to compare controls and tests of different ages

run_zerod_sim.py
    - givne a solver file, runs a zero d simulation of it

Step 0
    a. Clinical Stenosis
        - Retrieve Alagille and Williams patients (Ingrid's models) with already clinically identified stenosis (6)
        - Notes:
            - 
    b. Approximate Stenosis
        - Retrieve Alagille patients (2) who have stenosis but are not clinically identified
        - Utilize a Body Surface Area weighted control model and compute average resistances at each generation of vasculature to determine where in stenosed models a potential stenoses is.
        - Note:
            - What percent should we use: 
            - BSA's are taken from: https://www.gigacalculator.com/calculators/bsa-calculator.php
    c. Artificial stenoses
        - Take several control models and their 0d solver files. In segments within first 4 generations, increase resistances to simulate stenoses
        - Notes:
            - Increase corresponds to 50-75% occlusion
            - Method of generating stenoses.
            - Should we only stenose the stenoses branch that got split up into 3

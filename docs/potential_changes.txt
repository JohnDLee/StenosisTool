HOW to fix the lack of sensitivity

Changes to how artificial stenosis is determined (both in number of points, occlusion, how to distribute b/w generations)

Changes to how stenosis detection is calculated -> can map to a diameter based generation ordering (More similar to the paper)
- Perhaps another way to compute, maybe by pressures


In 3d to 0d Rcrs could implement a retuning feature?

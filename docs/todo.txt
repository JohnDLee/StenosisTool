TODO:
- Run a steady state of everything?
- Can you train with steady simulations? -> compare with steady and unsteady



- Add stenosis coefficients to the tuning framework
Done
- Tuning with stenosis coefficients (have to rerun 3D model with new bc given )
- Compare the resistance  R = P1 - P2 / Ql -> to  (More clinical) to parallel computation
    - Not very effective


Order
- Run healthy results
- Create a more accurate stenosis (Tuning stenosis coefficients using 3D solver and pressure drops and flow splits)
    - Need quantitative (can use Martins, but also include pressure drops)

#- Get more healthy data
- A more quantitative measure of accuracy for M1 solver

- Run/Setup Neural Network





Can figure out flow after treated stenosis point, but pressure upstream changes
For now , local pressure/flow after

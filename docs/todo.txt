- GENERATE CENTERLINES 1 by 1 for those that didn't work, remesh those that don't
Models with error:  ['0005_1001', '0119_0001', '0081_0001', '0084_0001',]


- write stenosis detection
    - I DON'T have BSA????? -> averagees (or take a height weight and compute BSA)
        - https://www.gigacalculator.com/calculators/bsa-calculator.php
    - R per mm of length comparison
    - use pressure drops (TO DO LATER)
- write artificial stenosis
    - AM I NOT STENOSING ENOUGH????
    - Multiply lengths by 10 to see if the effect makes sense by increasing pressure significantly
    - compare to a already stenosed model to see if values match
- Clinically identified
    - HOw to know which location it is???
    - Use pressure drops ~ 20% (TO DO LATER)
- Create Slides on what has been done.


- Model sample from Sobol Sampliing
    - Sample from hypercube
    - can sample
    - Do not sample uniformly (less from 50 - 90)
    - keep most results around the 80-90 percent




- ASK ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY class probs are based on generation?

    - FLOW FILES ARE SWAPPED FOR MOST DEV FILES

    - 

    inlet outlet areas of branch
    is observed pressure drop much larger than avg res b/w inlet and outlet. 



    Check pressures as outlets

    How to utilize BSA:
    https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpheart.00123.2020


    Compute resistances according to diameter changes



    Are resistances in tree making sense w/ area and length (units?)

    How much pressure is dropping within tree vs RCR bc

    delta P = Q * R 

    Go into 3 D and calculate what I think resistane is in MPA




    Basically -> THere is a pressure drop with stenosis in the arterial tree, but we aren't fixing enough length?
    The automatic may be attributing too much length to the junctions



    run a comparison on AS-1, 
    - for 0d set compliance to 0 on non outlets


- EHR is weird, Should match inflwo if L and C are 0
- Orders of magnitude



Get a 3D, change the coefficient untill pressures are close (hopefully converges), Can check accross pulmonaries to see if coefficient holds. find some sort of general rule.

Ask about C++ implementation

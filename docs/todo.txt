TODO:
- Run a steady state of everything?
- Can you train with steady simulations? -> compare with steady and unsteady



- Add stenosis coefficients to the tuning framework
Done
- Tuning with stenosis coefficients (have to rerun 3D model with new bc given )
- Compare the resistance  R = P1 - P2 / Ql -> to  (More clinical) to parallel computation
    - Not very effective


Order
1. Run healthy results (DOES NOT WORKKKKKKKKKK.)
    - Tried Changing TS... no solution
    - Flow is not correct for 0080_0001. So many orders of magnitude lower
    - PROPOSED SOLUTION: DO NOT PERFORM COMPARISONS WITH OWN DATA, BUT WITH MARTIN's ALREADY RUN DATA, JUST MODITY IN FILE


2?. Create a more accurate stenosis (Tuning stenosis coefficients using 3D solver and pressure drops and flow splits)
    - Using inlet, outlet areas
    - Need quantitative (can use Martins, but also include pressure drops)
    
3. Construct a more realistic artificial stenosis based on 0D solver


4. Run/Setup Neural Network
    - Can figure out flow after treated stenosis point, but pressure upstream changes
    - For now , local pressure/flow after


5. Get More Healthy Results


Slides
 Follow tree along branches and follow pressure alongm branch
 Construct Resistance tree

7. Iterate Optimizer if flow changes, or set distal pressure to 0 and try.



Cannot get








Can we use radial basis function

Need to optimize the neural network




Can we generate more stenosis then determine only the most extreme to fix.

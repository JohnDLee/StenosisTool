TODO:

- Make commented changes to zero D conversion (according to the paper)
- Write file script to be able to manually adjust 3 D solutions to needed data only
- Write file script to increase stenosis according to junctions
- Write script to analytically compare error values according to error terms




- Run healthy results


- Create a scatter plot of node

- Run a steady state of everything?
- Can you train with steady simulations? -> compare with steady and unsteady


- Compare the resistance  R = P1 - P2 / Ql -> to  (More clinical) to parallel computation

A more quantitative measure of accuracy for M1 solver




Can figure out flow after treated stenosis point, but pressure upstream changes
For now , local pressure/flow after
